# Custom Hooks for React

[![DeepScan grade](https://deepscan.io/api/teams/9705/projects/13151/branches/217467/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&tid=9705&pid=13151&bid=217467)

Some useful custom hooks for React by fliegwerk

## Abstract

This project is a collection of [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) for [React](https://reactjs.org/) used in fliegwerk and by fliegwerk.
All hooks are written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for better typings and IDE integrations.

We maybe release these hooks as a package in the future, but currently there are no ambitions to do so.
This repo is more like a general store and share for custom hooks.

So, if you have any nice custom hooks to share or hook/functionality ideas, please open a pull request or an issue!

## Issues and Contributing

We also included some coding standards, that you must follow.

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code style and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code syntax checks.
We also included some deepscans to check for vulnerable code.

Every hook obtains its own file.

Please include some nice [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to your custom hook, if possible.

Before you commit, please run:
```sh
$ npm run check
```
to check your code for styling and syntax.

If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/fliegwerk/react-custom-hooks/issues)
or write us: <https://www.fliegwerk.com/contact>
